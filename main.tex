\section{\scshape Introduction and Background}

\subsection{The Class (Electricity and Optics)}

\begin{frame}{Electricity and Optics}
	\framesubtitle{PHYS 24100 and 24100D}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Second Semester of Introductory Physics
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item The ``D'' Signifies a Distance Learning Section
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Uses Tipler and Mosca as the Textbook\footfullcite{tipler2003}
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Uses CHIP as the Homework System
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{``On Semester'' vs. ``Off Semester''}
	\framesubtitle{PHYS 24100 and 24100D}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fall is generally considered the on-semester while spring and summer are considered the off-semesters.
		\vspace{4mm}
		\item PHYS 17200 grades are generally higher in the fall semester than in the spring or summer.
		\vspace{4mm}
		\item Calculus grades are not significantly different between the fall, spring, and summer semesters.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Online vs. Campus Students}
	\framesubtitle{PHYS 24100 and 24100D}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Just under 10\% of the class is enrolled in a distance learning section in the spring and fall semesters.
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item 100\% of the students are enrolled in a distance learning section during the summer.
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item PHYS 17200 are not significantly different between the online and on-campus sections within a semester.
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Calculus grades are not significantly different between the online and on-campus sections within a semester.
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item We see rising enrollment numbers in the summer semester.

\subsection{Motivation for CITA}

\begin{frame}{The Need for CITA}
	\begin{quote}
	With all due respect, I am very displeased with CHIP.  It took me 45 minutes to solve one problem because I didn't round correctly.  I know it is not my place to say this, but I think that online HW submission programs should be done away with at universities like Purdue.  With that being said, I am going to power through this year in physics!
	\end{quote}
	\vspace{5mm}
	- Anonymous Student, Fall 2014 Semester
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Need for CITA}
	\begin{quote}
	Thank you for the help section in this problem! It was very well written and helped me figure out the problem and (hopefully) similar ones in the future!

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Need for CITA}
	\begin{quote}
	I found the IE [interactive examples] extremely helpful, and want these to continue to be available. It was much more helpful than examples in the book or just completing the homework, and I think it'd be great for more complicated problems especially.

\section{\scshape Methodology}

\subsection{Schedule of Development and Analysis}

\begin{frame}{Schedule of Development}
	\begin{table}[ht]
		\caption{In the spring semester of 2015 (and before), the CHIP homework system included 29 ``interactive examples'' that were originally developed by the faculty at UIUC (out of 139 homework problems total).}
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
				\hline
				\textbf{Semester} & \textbf{Section} & \textbf{Version}\\
				\hline
				Spring 2015 and Before & Campus & Pre-CITA\\
				& Online & Pre-CITA\\
				\hline
				Summer 2015 & Online & 1.0 (Beta)\\
				\hline
				Fall 2015 & Campus & 2.0\\
				& Online & 1.0 (Beta)\\
				\hline
				Spring 2016 & Campus & 3.0\\
				& Online & 3.0\\
				\hline
				Summer 2016 & Online & 3.0\\
				\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		\label{tab:schedule}
	\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Schedule of Analysis}
	We employed the sequential exploratory strategy since it is useful for the development and testing of a new instrument. One repeats phases of qualitative data analysis followed by phases of quantitative data analysis\footfullcite{creswell2003}.
	\vspace{3mm}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The project started with an analysis of student comments along with a literature review.
		\item We collected quantitative data during the semester and qualitative data at the end of the semester.
		\item We analyzed one type of data while collecting the other.
		\item We performed a final recap analysis in the summer of 2016.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Quantitative Procedures}

\begin{frame}{Quantitative Data}
	Quantitative data came from a variety of sources:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Homework, Quiz, and Exam Scores
		\item BEMA Concept Inventory
		\item Multi-Step Problem
		\item End-of-Semester Surveys Based on Likert Scale
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quantitative Data}
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{img/matlab_example_1.png}
		\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{img/matlab_example_2.png}
		\caption{Additionally, we could track student clicks within the assignments.}
		\label{fig:matlab_examples}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Qualitative Procedures}

\begin{frame}{Strategy of Inquiry}
	Qualitative data for this project came from three major sources:
	\vspace{1mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Final Question from Exit Survey
		\item Piazza Comments
		\item Focus Group Sessions
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{5mm}
	We analyzed the qualitative data for this \textit{phenomenological study} using a three-cycle coding plan\footfullcite{saldana2012}:
	\vspace{1mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{First Cycle:} Attribute and Descriptive Coding
		\item \textbf{Second Cycle:} Elaborative and Pattern Coding
		\item \textbf{Third Cycle:} Evaluation and Longitudinal Coding
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Focus Group Sessions}
	Focus group sessions were used for a variety of reasons\footfullcite{hennink2014}:
	\vspace{1mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Exploratory, explanatory, and evaluative research
		\item Large amounts of data with a range of viewpoints
		\item Limits researcher influence
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{5mm}
	We used purposeful sampling as our design strategy\footfullcite{patton2015}:
	\vspace{1mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Overall Impression of the Homework System
		\item Online vs. On-Campus Section of the Class
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Roles of the Researchers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Cyrus Vandrevala:} Teaching Assistant, Course Coordinator, Developed Online Course, Developed CITA Tutorials, Led Focus Group Sessions, Data Analysis
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item \textbf{Hisao Nakanishi:} Helped Develop CHIP and CITA, Scheduled Assignments, Answered Student Questions Through CHIP, Data Analysis
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item \textbf{Laura Pyrak-Nolte:} Course Administrator, Course Instructor, Lecturer for Online Sections, Data Analysis
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item \textbf{Lynn Bryan:} Theoretical Background
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item \textbf{Andrew Hirsch:} Instructor for PHYS 17200
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item \textbf{Gary Johns:} Teaching Assistant (24100 and 17200), Data Analysis
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape Major Results}

\begin{frame}{Two Major Results}
	There are a lot of interesting results that have come from this study. We are going to focus on two.
